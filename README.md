These files are in the public domain and only consist of one glyph, U+E000. (Excluding spacing characters that FontForge added on its own, for some reason. Shouldn't cause issues.)

There should be bitmaps of sizes `8,10,12,14,16,20,24,32,48,56` embedded.

Please refer to Releases to download the "fonts".
